# HANGMAN'S REVENGE

## PURPOSE
Who didn’t enjoy playing the age-old game, “Hangman,” as a kid? Hangman’s Revenge is a simple web-based application that provides users that same enjoyable experience without the chalk or pencil stains on the side of your hand. Utilizing APIs from GIPHY and Datamuse, this new version of the classic game presents users with randomly generated words and provides them with clues in the form of related GIFs. As users select letters to fill in the remaining blank spaces of each new word, they are subject to the scathing insults of our vengeful hangman! At each game’s end, users can view all of the words they have previously encountered to find out their meaning. Hangman’s Revenge is the new spin on an old favorite, keeping you entertained and forever expanding your vocabulary!
